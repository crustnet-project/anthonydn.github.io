    <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

    <h2>What are the general requirements to participate?</h2>
    <p>To participate in the network, researchers need to commit to select and establish at least one node, survey the node, and provide samples for coordinated analysis. Participants must be able to accurately identify all biocrust species at their site, though the PI team can help with difficult taxa.</p>

    <h2>How do I sign up?</h2>
    <p>If you are interested in participating in CrustNet, please fill out our intake form at  
    <a href="https://qualtrics.nau.edu/jfe/form/SV_0UrXWzHhjPmKRZs" target="_blank">this link</a>. Feel free to contact Sierra Jech or any member of the PI team with questions.</p>

    <h2>What site characteristics are required for a CrustNet node?</h2>
    <p>We seek nodes in distinct ecoregions that support biocrusts, including drylands, alpine areas, polar areas, and other regions. Nodes should have the following characteristics:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Landowner’s / user’s / agency permission to conduct research can be obtained.</li>
      <li>Substantial biocrust cover (at least 10% across the whole node, with at least some high-cover patches).</li>
      <li>Approximately 1 hectare (ha) in size. The area must accommodate a representative 30 m radius circular area (2827 m²), several dozen quadrats (0.25 m × 0.25 m to 0.5 m × 0.5 m; some permanent if Tier 2), and optional experimental infrastructure such as biocrust transplants or rainfall reduction shelters (if Tier 3). Flat sites are preferred for logistical reasons, but sloping sites may be included.</li>
      <li>For Tier 2 and 3: Return visits must be feasible.</li>
      <li>Sites must be 10 km apart from another node (with a few exceptions if very different surface types co-occur). See <a href="https://crustnet.org/nodes.html" target="_blank">current node map</a>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Do I need to sample my node at a particular time of year?</h2>
    <p>The timing of sampling is intentionally flexible and depends partly on which CrustNet components are being done. Some best practices are:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Tier 1 sampling is best conducted outside of peak annual plant biomass to facilitate better visibility of biocrusts and avoid confusing functional effects of biocrusts and annual plants.</li>
      <li>It is advisable to visit sites when dry (in between rain events) to reduce the need to dry soils later and to eliminate soil measurement variability.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>What is involved in each sampling tier: Tier 1, Tier 2, and Tier 3?</h2>
    <p>The protocol is divided into a tiered system:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Tier 1</strong> requires one-time survey activities, which are designed to be easy and low-cost.</li>
      <li><strong>Tier 2</strong> requires the establishment of simple, low-cost experiments and repeated monitoring.</li>
      <li><strong>Tier 3</strong> involves the establishment of experimental infrastructure and voluntary components, requiring greater investment in terms of time, labor, or cost.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Researchers who conduct Tier 2 and/or 3 will need to maintain their site for at least 3 years and fund their own infrastructure and implementation.</p>

    <h2>What is the time and personnel commitment required to run a CrustNet node?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Tier 1:</strong> 5–6 people, 2 days. One visit.</li>
      <li><strong>Tier 2:</strong> 5–6 people, 3 days. Initial visit plus two additional visits over a three-year period.</li>
      <li><strong>Tier 3:</strong> 
        <ul>
          <li><em>Drought component:</em> ½ day, 2 people, two additional visits over three years + ~$1000 in equipment (some cost defrayal may be possible).</li>
          <li><em>Common garden component:</em> Requires coordination with the PI team; not required for all Tier 3 participants.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How does authorship work?</h2>
    <p>CrustNet authorship is designed to be fair, inclusive, and transparent. Groups contributing Tier 1 data receive co-authorship for two members on the four planned core papers. Additional Tier 2 and Tier 3 contributions lead to co-authorship on further papers. All contributors will be co-authors on a “data paper” compiling the full dataset.</p>
    <p>Proposals for new manuscripts using CrustNet data must be reviewed by the Steering Committee to avoid overlap, but participants are always free to publish using data from their own plots.</p>

    <h2>Can I add my own project idea?</h2>
    <p>Yes! Not only can participants use data from their own plots, we are also open to the development of side projects that leverage project data components.</p>
